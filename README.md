Python OpenAI Voice Assistant (Virtual Aguida)
This is a Python program that uses OpenAI to create a voice assistant that can have a conversation with the user. The user can speak into the microphone, and the program will use speech recognition to convert the audio into text. The text is then sent to OpenAI's text generation API, which generates a response based on the conversation history.

Installation
Before running the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

speech_recognition
pyttsx3
openai
playsound
gtts
You can install these dependencies using pip. For example:

pip install speechrecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install openai
pip install playsound
pip install gtts

Usage
To run the program, simply run the voice_assistant.py script. The program will prompt you to speak, and you can start having a conversation with the voice assistant.

By default, the voice assistant will use OpenAI's text-davinci-002 model, which provides human-like responses. If you want to use a different model, you can change the model parameter in the openai.Completion.create() method call in line 32.

You can also modify the temperature, max_tokens, top_p, frequency_penalty, and presence_penalty parameters to change how OpenAI generates the responses.
